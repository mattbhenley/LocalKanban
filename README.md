# LocalKanban
a local kanban board to keep up with work, life, and all. 

A few things worth noting:

* To Do → In Progress → Done flow with quick arrow buttons on each card so you can move tasks forward/back without dragging
* Drag & drop still works too
* Stats pill in the header shows total tasks and how many are done (e.g. "3/7 done")
* Same notes, tags, edit/delete features as before
* Press n as a keyboard shortcut to quickly add a new task

Both boards save to localStorage independently, so you can use both without them interfering with each other!
